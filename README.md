## Final Project Proposal (TeamUP)

### Collective Foraging/Flocking

This project aims to explore the fascinating world of collective foraging and flocking, focusing on algorithms that describe how entities flock together and how artificial agents efficiently retrieve items from the environment.

### 1. What is Collective Foraging/Flocking?

Collective foraging/flocking refers to the behavior exhibited by a group of entities (e.g., birds, fish, or artificial agents) where they move or work together in a coordinated manner. This behavior is often seen in nature and has been the subject of various studies in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics.


This project is an exciting exploration of the intersection between nature and technology, and we hope it will provide valuable insights into the behavior of collective entities, whether they be birds in the sky, fish in the sea, or robots in a warehouse.
